          When it comes to cloud infrastructure, DevOps pipelines, and
          automation, I’m here to help you streamline your workflows and build
          scalable, efficient solutions. With a strong background in Python,
          cloud services, and automation tools, I can support your project at
          every stage – from planning to deployment. Let’s take your ideas and
          turn them into reliable, scalable solutions.

          <ServiceItem title="DevOps & Automation">
            Efficient and scalable systems are built on automation. I can help
            you implement tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, and Terraform
            to automate repetitive tasks, manage complex infrastructures, and
            reduce errors. Together, we can ensure your infrastructure is
            running smoothly and consistently.
          </ServiceItem>
          <ServiceItem title="Cloud Solutions">
            Whether you’re using Azure or AWS, I’ll help design and implement
            cloud architectures that meet your unique business needs. From cloud
            migration to setting up secure, scalable environments, I’ll ensure
            your cloud solutions are optimized for performance, security, and
            cost-efficiency.
          </ServiceItem>
          <ServiceItem title="CI/CD Pipelines">
            Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines
            are the backbone of a fast and reliable development process. I can
            create custom pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions, Azure
            Pipelines, or Jenkins to automate testing, deployment, and
            monitoring of your applications.
          </ServiceItem>
          <ServiceItem title="Infrastructure as Code (IaC)">
            Say goodbye to manual configurations and ensure your infrastructure
            is reproducible, scalable, and version-controlled. Using Terraform
            and ARM templates, I’ll automate the provisioning of your cloud
            resources, helping you manage infrastructure with the same
            discipline as code.
          </ServiceItem>
          <ServiceItem title="Python & Go Development">
            From automation scripts to full-scale web applications, I can help
            you write clean, maintainable, and efficient code in Python and Go.
            Whether you’re looking to build something from scratch or optimize
            existing codebases, I’ve got you covered.
