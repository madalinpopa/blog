Not so long ago, I discovered `direnv`, which has become an essential tool in my daily workflow. I found it so practical and easy to use that I thought I’d dedicate a blog post to it.

Direnv is a simple tool that acts as a shell extension, and all it does is load and unload environment variables based on the current directory. Apparently, this doesn’t seem like a big deal, and maybe you don’t see how it could be useful, but let me give you an example.

### Key Benefits

Before diving into the details, here's why direnv is worth your attention:

- **Automated Environment Switching**: Environment variables load automatically when you enter a project directory
- **Project Isolation**: Each project maintains its own environment configuration
- **Security**: Better control over sensitive information
- **Development Efficiency**: No more manual exports or sourcing of environment files

Let’s say you have multiple projects with different configurations and secrets. The most obvious way to handle this is to have a `.env` file in each project and load it manually—unless you want to keep all the secrets in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file or export them manually every time you switch between projects. This is where `direnv` will save you. It will automatically load the `.env` file when you `cd` into the project directory and unload it when you `cd` out.

Let’s see how you can install and use `direnv` on your system.

### Installation

Direnv comes packaged for most Linux distributions, so you can install it using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install it with:

```bash
sudo apt install direnv
```
On macOS, you can use Homebrew:

```bash
brew install direnv
```

You also have the option to install it manually by downloading the binary from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/direnv/direnv).

### Usage

Now that we have direnv installed, we can use it in any project by changing the directory to our project and create our first environment variable and save it to `.envrc` file.

```bash
cd my-project
echo export FOO=foo > .envrc
```
This will create a new file named `.envrc` in the project directory with the content `export FOO=foo`. To make this environment variable available in the current shell, we need to allow direnv to load it by running:

```bash
direnv allow .
```
With this command we are allowing direnv to load the environment variables found in the `.envrc` file in the current directory. With this done, we can check if the environment variable is loaded by running:

```bash
echo $FOO
```

This way, we can expose the secrets and configurations needed by the project without cluttering our shell configuration files. But we can do more: we can tell direnv to automatically load the environment variables when we change to a directory that contains a `.envrc` file.

To do that, we need to add the following line at the end of our shell configuration file (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc.). For example, if you are using zsh, you can add the following line to your `.zshrc` file:

```bash
eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"
```

With this in place, whenever we change to a directory that contains a `.envrc` file, direnv will automatically load the environment variables defined in that file.

One more nice thing that I like to do with direnv is to extend the $PATH variable with the `bin` directory of the project. This way, I can have project-specific binaries that I can use in the project directory without having to specify the full path to the binary. This can be done by adding in .envrc file the following line:

```bash
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
```

**Security Note**: Remember to add `.envrc` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidentally committing sensitive information:

### Conclusion

Direnv is a simple tool that can save you from typing extra commands or forgetting to load the environment variables needed by your project. Not only will it improve your experience with managing configurations and secrets, but it’s also more secure than having all your secrets exposed system-wide.
